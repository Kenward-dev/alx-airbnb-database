# Airbnb Clone - Sample Data Creation

## Summary

I created a comprehensive set of SQL INSERT statements to populate our Airbnb clone database with realistic Nigerian sample data:

- Added 7 users with Nigerian names, contact information, and various roles
- Created 9 addresses across major Nigerian cities with real street names
- Created 6 properties with Nigerian-specific descriptions and pricing in Naira
- Added 7 bookings showing different reservation statuses
- Created payment methods referencing Nigerian banks
- Recorded 5 completed payments linked to confirmed bookings
- Added 5 property reviews with authentic Nigerian context
- Generated 8 messages between users with locally relevant conversations
- Simulated uuids for the different entity ids
