# Airbnb Clone Project Database Schema Summary

## Overview
Created a comprehensive SQL database schema for our airbnb clone project, focusing on proper table design and relationships to support the application's functionality.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Database Structure Implementation
- Defined eight essential tables with appropriate relationships
- Created dedicated tables for users, properties, bookings, and communications
- Established a separate `Address` table for location management
- Implemented a `PaymentMethod` table for flexible payment handling

### 2. SQL Implementation
- Created complete `CREATE TABLE` statements with:
  - Proper data types and field sizes
  - Primary key constraints using UUID
  - Foreign key relationships with explicit constraints
  - Check constraints for data validation
  - Default values for timestamps and boolean fields
  - Unique constraints for fields like email

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Added strategic indexes for:
  - Foreign keys to improve join operations
  - Search fields like email and property attributes
  - Date ranges for booking searches
  - User relationships (host, guest, sender, recipient)

## Schema Structure

The final schema includes eight well-structured tables:
1. `User` - Core user information with role distinction
2. `Address` - Detailed location data
3. `Property` - Rental property information linked to address
4. `Booking` - Reservation details with date validation
5. `PaymentMethod` - Saved user payment methods
6. `Payment` - Transaction records linked to bookings
7. `Review` - Property ratings and comments
8. `Message` - Communication between users
